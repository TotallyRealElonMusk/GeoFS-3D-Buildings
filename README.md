# 3D Buildings for Geo-FS
This addon adds 3D buildings for airports, landmarks, and other stuff. We also have carriers with collision points. Just copy and paste the GeoFS-3D.js contents into Tampermonkey. You might need to reload your game the first time.
Made by AF267, Eco and Elon, with the help of GT, Echo_3, Speedbird, and GeoFlyDream.
