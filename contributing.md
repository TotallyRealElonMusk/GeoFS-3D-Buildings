# Geo-FS 3D Buildings contributing handbook

Hi there, if you would like to contribute, feel free! We always are looking for new helpers to our team!

You can do whatever model you want to do, as long as it exists in real life. Once done, you export it in GLB/GLTF format, and send it to us via our discord server. You also need to give us the coordinates of the model. Once done, we will add it in game! 

#### Need Assistance?
Feel free to open an issue, and we'll be happy to help!
