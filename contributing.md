# Geo-FS 3D Buildings contributing handbook

Hi there, if you would like to contribute, feel free! We always are looking for new helpers to our team!

You can do whatever model you want to do, as long as it exists in real life (or is under construction). Once done, you export it in GLB/GLTF format, and send it to us via our discord server, or email it to us [here](https://geofs3d.wixsite.com/buildtheearth/contact-us). You also need to give us the coordinates of the model (can be found on google maps). You can also use free 3d models off of the internet if you wish, but be careful to ensure that they have the correct licenses (to prevent any legal issues). If you do use models made by other people, please send us the name of the creator and the link to the download page for the model as well.  Once done, we will add it in game! 

Lets get building!
